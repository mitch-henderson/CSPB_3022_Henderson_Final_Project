# SMS Spam Detection: Machine Learning Classification
By **Mitchell Henderson**, CSPB 3022

## Project Overview:
Leveraging [machine learning techniques](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/), this project classifies a dataset of text messages into two categories: spam or ham.

## Platform:
This project is presented as a Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have access to Jupyter to view and execute its contents.

## Data Description:
The SMS Spam Collection is a public compilation of SMS messages curated for research on mobile phone spam detection.

## Data Sources:
- **Unicamp**: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/)
- **Kaggle**: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
