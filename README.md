**PROJECT DESCRIPTION **SMS Spam Detection Machine Learning **Classification **Mitchell Henderson CSPB 3022

I use [machine learning to perform a classification](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/) where I classify database of text messages either as spam or ham.

This is a Jupyter Notebook. You will need access to Jupyter to open and run this notebook.

Description of data: The SMS Spam Collection is a public set of SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research.
